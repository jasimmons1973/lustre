/** \defgroup heap Binary heap
 *
 * The binary heap is a scalable data structure created using a binary tree. It
 * is capable of maintaining large sets of elements sorted usually by one or
 * more element properties, but really based on anything that can be used as a
 * binary predicate in order to determine the relevant ordering of any two nodes
 * that belong to the set. There is no search operation, rather the intention is
 * for the element of the lowest priority which will always be at the root of
 * the tree (as this is an implementation of a min-heap) to be removed by users
 * for consumption.
 *
 * Users of the heap should embed a \e struct cfs_binheap_node object instance
 * on every object of the set that they wish the binary heap instance to handle,
 * and (at a minimum) provide a struct cfs_binheap_ops::hop_compare()
 * implementation which is used by the heap as the binary predicate during its
 * internal sorting operations.
 *
 * The current implementation enforces no locking scheme, and so assumes the
 * user caters for locking between calls to insert, delete and lookup
 * operations. Since the only consumer for the data structure at this point
 * are NRS policies, and these operate on a per-CPT basis, binary heap instances
 * are tied to a specific CPT.
